## üí° About the project

> _This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which
was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you‚Äôll have to find your way._
For more detailed information, look at the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/mouadd55/cub3D-42Cursus/blob/0bd309a9770733bf127d00e17b79cbc9b2fd58f9/cub3d.pdf).

# cub3D: Exploring Ray-Casting in C

cub3D is a graphic design project inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, allowing users to explore ray-casting and create a dynamic view inside a maze. This project serves as a playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics, focusing on windows, colors, events, and shape filling, all built using the C programming language.

## Introduction

Developed by Id Software and published in 1992 by Apogee Software, Wolfenstein 3D is considered the first true "First Person Shooter" in the history of video games. It laid the foundation for subsequent games like Doom (1993), Duke Nukem 3D (1996), and Quake (1996), serving as eternal milestones in the gaming world.

In this project, you get to relive history by creating a dynamic view inside a maze, inspired by the mechanics of Wolfenstein 3D, where you'll have to find your way through.
